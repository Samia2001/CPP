DFS
1) Detect cycle in an undirected graph
2) If the graph is Bipartite
3) Given a grid of dimension nxm containing 0s and 1s. Find the unit area of the largest region of 1s.
4) Given a Directed Graph, find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (if present). 
A Mother Vertex is a vertex through which we can reach all the other vertices of the Graph.
5) topological sort
6) 2 edge connectivity
7) Strongly connected
8) is it a graph
9) is it a tree
10)diameter of a graph
